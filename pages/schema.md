All digital pre-departure test results issued in Singapore are to comply with the HealthCerts schema. This will facilitate the notarisation of HealthCerts at the <a href="https://notarise.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Notarise Portal</a>, which can then be used for purposes of travelling abroad.

Visit this page for the <a href="https://schemata.openattestation.com/" target="_blank">latest HealthCerts schema</a>.
